Calculator project from TheOdinProject curriculum. 

Made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

-second commit: 
Fixed some bugs and changed the UI a little, still some bugs left to iron out. 
Thinking of rewriting and simplifying the backend, possibly using a different method but we'll see in the third commit/update. 

-third commit: 
Rewrote entire backend to simplify code and fix all bugs I could find. 
Tweaked UI colors and added 'Help' button for explaining keyboard keys.
Also finished with keyboard support. Now it meets all of the criteria.

-fourth commit: 
Tweaked colors on mobile displays because my laptop has poor color accuracy.

-fifth commit: 
fixed two bugs I found. I'm fairly sure everything in the backend
is fixed. I'm going to continue to tweak colors because I'm not 
sure how to reliably set colors because my laptop screen has poor
color accuracy. We will see.
