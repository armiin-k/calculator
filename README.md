Calculator project from TheOdinProject curriculum. 

Made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

-second commit: 
Fixed some bugs and changed the UI a little, still some bugs left to iron out. 
Thinking of rewriting and simplifying the backend, possibly using a different method but we'll see in the third commit/update. 

-third commit: 
Rewrote entire backend to simplify code and fix all bugs I could find. 
Tweaked UI colors and added 'Help' button for explaining keyboard keys.
Also finished with keyboard support. Now it meets all of the criteria.

-fourth commit: 
Tweaked colors on mobile displays because my laptop has poor color accuracy.
